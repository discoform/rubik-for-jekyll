## Halfway into their second decade, 'My Name Is Wendy' produces brand identities, typefaces, illustrations, patterns, concepts and printings.

The View Writer typeface was created by the radical design duo of Carole Gautier and Eugénie Favre in 2009. The typeface has since been integrated into cultural identities and editorial content such as the Scénographies de Dan Graham à Hubert Rober, and is now remastered for purchase from My Name Is Wendy.

### View Writer is available in the following packs:

- Bold + Slanted (Text & simple version) > 50€ 
- Regular + Slanted (Text & simple version) > 50€ 
- Light + Slanted (Text & simple version) > 50€ 
- Full pack > 130€
